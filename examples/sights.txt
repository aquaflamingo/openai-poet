Sights

For we work these damn years, only to see from hollowed sights,
Something greener than our future, something greater than our plight,
Our one-eyed concubine of garden nights, the honeyed leer of the moon,
Something nearing us, something nearing us to kill us through or in our dream,
Our suicides of boredom, casually exact in memorized grief.

When the future came I was in bed and dreaming, and I was glad,
A clear dose of the world, to worry me--and then another, without end.
Poem Title: Dear Sirs
Who high up on mountain-bench, pick out letters of heaven's script
